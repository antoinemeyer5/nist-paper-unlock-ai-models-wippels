This paper aims to present the work carried out to (1) increase the number of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models usable in a scientific workflow engine
called Web Image Processing Pipeline (WIPP), (2) document the AI models used,
and (3) compare results of executing different AI models on the same dataset in
order to select the best. We have thus seen both the potential and the
limitations of reusing general models. Overall, it's a good practice to reuse
well-documented models to get a first idea of the results without wasting too
many resources creating, training, documenting and using a model. This process
must be simple, automatic and reliable: these are the 3 points that WIPP solves
for biological images.
