This paper aims to present the work carried out to (1) increase the number of
\Gls{AI} models usable in a scientific workflow engine
called \Gls{WIPP}, (2) document the \Gls{AiModel}s used,
and (3) compare results of executing different \Gls{AiModel}s on the same dataset in
order to select the best. We have thus seen both the potential and the
limitations of reusing general models. Overall, it's a good practice to reuse
well-documented models to get a first idea of the results without wasting too
many resources creating, training, documenting and using a model. This process
must be simple, automatic and reliable: these are the 3 points that \Gls{WIPP} solves
for biological images.
