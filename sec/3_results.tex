\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Access new repositories give access to nearly 4,000 models from Hugging Face
\TODO\ [ADD SAM2, ADD CELLPOSE] and more than 50 models from BioImage.IO. It
also saves hours of computational time and resources, as well as improves
reusability of pre-trained AI models.

The level of documentation varies greatly from model to model. We have set up an
automatic documentation system for models trained within Web Image Processing
Pipeline (WIPP).

To avoid lower confidence in external models, we have developed a way of
evaluating the results and therefore the relevance of the models tested, in
order to select and retain only those that deliver the best results.
