\section{Results}

Access new repositories give access to a lot of new models usable in Web Image
Processing Pipeline (WIPP). It also saves hours of computational time and
resources, as well as improves reusability of pre-trained AI models.

In the context of Image Analysis in WIPP, we are looking to use Mask
Generation Models.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:number_of_newly_available_models}%
  Number of newly available Mask Generation models
}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
  \toprule
  Repository & Mask Generation Model(s) \\
  \midrule
  WIPP & 1 \\
  Hugging Face & 176 \\
  BioImage.IO & 32 \\
  Cellpose & 21 \\
  SAM2 & 8 \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The level of documentation varies greatly from model to model. We have set up an
automatic documentation system for models trained within WIPP.

Finally to avoid lower confidence in external models, we have developed a way of
evaluating the results and therefore the relevance of the models tested, in
order to select and retain only those that deliver the best results.

The computer used was (Nvidia Quatro RTX 4000)  \TODO\ \TODO\ \TODO\ \TODO\ \TODO\

Even if the results may not be perfect, this method allows you to quickly try
out a new model at reduced cost. We can then take a promising model and improve
it by finetuning it. We hope to improve the speed of data analysis within WIPP
and enable better overall results.
