\begin{abstract}

This paper aims to present the work carried out to lower the barriers for
reusing trained AI models available in AI models repositories. This problem is
challenging because AI models are spread on lot of different repositories and
formats, it's not trivial to setup and execute AI models for non-technical
researchers and re-train models from scratch take lot of time and money. Our
motivations are that this work can accelerate application of AI models to
scientific problems and save hours of computation time by reusing pre-trained
models from diverse repositories. Some APIs or tools like Transformers (Hugging
Face API), Cellpose API, BioImage.IO Core or SAM2 repository already allows
users to download, inference and train AI models. We leverage this in Web Image
Processing Pipelines by using above APIs and adding documentation with AI model
cards.

Keywords: AI model reuse, AI model card, public API to AI repositories
